For country code {{detail.country_code}}, 
I have a list of field names and their corresponding descriptions, which is delimited by triple quotes. 
\\\ {{detail.field_name_description}} \\\          
I also have a source table called {{detail.source_table_name}} 
I want to generate ABAP CDS view fields for each of them.
