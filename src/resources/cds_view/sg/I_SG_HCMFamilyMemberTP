This is a definition of a view entity in ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) language. The view entity is named `I_SG_HCM_ESSFamilyMemberTP` and it is defined to select data from `I_HCM_ESSFamilyMember` with a parameter `P_HCMInfoTypeVersion` set to '10'.

The view entity has several associations to other entities such as `I_SG_HCM_ESSFamilyMemberRootTP`, `I_SG_HCMFamilyMemberSupplement`, `C_HCMNationalityText`, `I_HCMGenderText`, and `I_CountryText`. These associations are defined based on certain conditions.

The view entity also defines a set of fields that are selected from `I_HCM_ESSFamilyMember` and some of them are associated with value help definitions and text associations.

The `@` annotations are used to provide additional metadata for the view entity. For example, `@EndUserText.label` provides a label for the view entity, `@AccessControl.authorizationCheck` specifies that no authorization check is required, and `@ObjectModel.usageType` specifies the usage type of the view entity.
